# Helicopter Program

## Description
- This is an interactive program where a user can perform many different operations, as many as they choose, until they decide to close the program. A user can create or delete helicopters from their fleet, view the entire fleet, choose helicopters to fly, load cargo into cargo helicopters, make attack helicopters dog fight, the user can hire new pilots, the user can even save any helicopters created while running the application and have them loaded the next time program is started. Additionally the user can see a dynamically generated helicopter that is the current fastest or has the longest range depending on user choice.

#New Lessons Learned
- try-catch statements
- read and write from .txt file
- using interfaces
- creating class hierarchies
- abstract classes and methods
- ArrayLists

#Limitations
- Application stores data in a text file rather than a database. In certain use cases user can break application by entering wrong type of data.
